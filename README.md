- I build Tesla Coils.
- I spend some of my time thinking about the Subgraph Isomorphism problem.
- My main interests are in theoretical computer science.
- I'm the president of the Linux Users Group at ASU.
- I do not maintain an online presence outside this page and my [personal
  website](https://agentelement.net) (`https` only! `http://agentelement.net`
  will not work!).
- `vi > emacs`

My website is self-hosted by a server under a couch. If you cannot access my
personal website, more likely than not, there is some problem with that server.
Please be patient, and email
[issues@agentelement.net](mailto:issues@agentelement.net) if the outage
persists for a while.
